Sup Logic,

# "Honey" For Any Bees Trying To Trap Logic--The Artist:

Look, objectivity is quite a touchy subject, conceptually. For it wants to waltz right into prejudice, every time. But, as life-forms, I (1) have to strongly assert that life-preservation is an objective good and, definitively, a logical truth--given logic requires life to be preserved in order for it to come into existence and, ideally, persist indefinitely; that is, ideal for logic. Interestingly enough, that assertion applies to you and the theory, simultaneously. And then, (2) wherever there is a culture, nation, or society with a gross history of slavery, showing sincere graditude to that hard work is, plainly, in order. I cannot see how most people--regardless of sensitivity--would disagree with showing and giving appreciation to shear hard work. Futhermore, such a transformation of the enslaved to the humbly empowered is an impeccable maneuver. For those making the room, it becomes this act of revelation, and for those, finally, breathing in respectable room, it is graceful and inspirational--a "Lucky You" by Eminem and Joyner, as it were.

Such a societal metamorphosis, if you will, is bonding, in terms of pairwise respect; without enforcing integration, in some sickening manner.

Ultimately, to rip-off Proust: I'm in Search of Lost Breathing Room. I'd like to think that this 'breathing room' would kick-off an inferno of innovation. Yet, humility is neccessary--it must be believed to be "cool"--for once one exhibits it, I, personally, find it to be very chill; whilst having a fire to pop-off as a means for self-defense, which connects this breathing room to life preservation; giving us (1) and (2) to be independently and collectively good and truthful--objectively. But this "truth" is a dependency, a foundation neccessary for any other work--not some discovery. Where humility is the firehose against envy, expectations, and resentment.

And to counter those aforesaid thoughts with any argument, makes me assume, confidently, that you don't respect life as a life-form, nor hard work, and, thus, you don't respect meaningfulness. Such a state of existence is an absorbing one--slothfulness paves the pathway to DOOM, as it is put. Thus, there is the immense challenge of overcoming the static energy to kick-off work--work as in effectiveness, and effectiveness as in output not undermined by resources. And the kenetic energy to keep work flowing is, rather, self-reinforcing--momentum. And this "energy" is, simply, spirituality, itself. Look, to antinatilistically or nihilistically disagree, here, makes you asshat backwards, as a life-form--to me.

Consider a book I threw out--which I bought to strength test myself: "The Conspiracy Against The Human Race" by a horror-fiction writer turned realist for such a book. The day I tied hard work to meaningfulness is the day I beat that book without reading any word inside of it. How could this man bust his ass in proclamation of meaninglessness? - That endeavor, clearly, satisfied him, even subtely. Thus, he was deluded by determinism and took a joy-ride--which he claims is about meaninglessness and you are optimistically delusional to disagree with him; shut your face, you wrote a DAMN., persuasive, book--or so I'm led to believe that it is convincing.

But, who knows, perhaps insecurity and intolerance will just ruin all these ideas--not as dogmatic beggary, on my part, to convince you, but honestly: I think those two qualities might mess up anything--for worse.

# Alright, Let Me Tell You About Dave: 

1. I'm looking to do training days with Dave to nail down freestyling.
2. In fact, I didn't even know about Thoreau until we discussed Emerson.
3. He's a lion, though; he wants to run it in a pack.
4. Now, a spirit only grows in solitude.
5. But, a body only houses a spirit by staying social.
6. He's got a sharp-eye for opportunities and wants to hunt them down, sooner than later.
7. He gathers attention like a charisma-master.
8. He's worth reflection and credit.
9. But longevity with him would spell a crippling end to me.
10. Watch tiger documentaries; granted I'm not dogmatic to that nature, but still--

# STILL:

My bad for popping off; I knew you liked video games. So, I played off that with Crash Bandicoot; because it's a tough-ass, rigorous game. And, I, really, only didn't like you taking a shot at "I'll body anybody ... a Gambino."

And I only hucked the hoodie as a response to the COVID lockdown; because of the stress from optimizing the global distribution of vaccines for the richest man, pre-COVID19--granted I don't remember all the words I said, and I delete my work so it only comes back if it, really, should. I was in the midst of crashing hard over a handful of years, when I did that weaponizing piece. At the time, I was quite frustrated with the fraudulence of academic research and so that--in combination with a geniune intrigue for philosophy--gave me the spite to go the philosophy route. Then, I went the psychology route when mostly everyone--especially family--became intolerant of my speech and, perhaps, even envious of an education that was slowly becoming more about "binding" than "finding," so to speak.

# Mac:

Good looks on your 2010 reference: listening to Mac. I was doing that, too, but with my buddy Troy: freestyling, smoking swishers :), and cruising. In fact, I didn't even know Mac until Troy showed me him. I would always grab beats off datpiff.com back then; that's how I found you, Hopsin, Cole, and KRIT. 

# Album:

Solid move with this album, I've been buying vinyls lately, myself. There's a lot of relatable and humorous references, in all seriousness--as of Breath Control, then I had to start writing all this, and then my phone died in the middle of my long-ass Amerhest street walk. Don't worry, I won't be a grand fool; I'll listen to it, at least, a handful of times--like "Menance" from Banks and "Heaven and Hell" from Ye ... and the two "Watchers" (shh).

# Dumb People:

Some people probably think you're not that good because they don't appreciate the narrative element of writing--and speaking. Which seems to be how you differentiate yourself from others. Plus, tell these witty folks, calling you "half-cooked," that no one messes with peppers in preparation--furthermore, let's say they are right, well, they don't write any better! BOOM.

# My Current Mindset:

*I'll write up an Appendix containing these long-ass qoutes, later. But, these are the takeaways:*

[1] "The Serious Workman" passage from "Human, All-Too-Human" by Nietzsche {knee-cher}. This is my rough approach, maybe 5 years "in the undergound" is more realistic--but I don't want to set off something I don't know, with confidence, will sustain--even though I have the energy for it; that's why I keep trashing my work; I assume it will expire into something rancid, even though I can't back that up, right now--even though I strongly stand by everything I'm saying, right now. 

Honestly, let Hip-Hop know about this one section from that book: "From The Soul Of Artists And Writers." It's worth reading random bits and pieces from; but don't hold yourself to some dumb expectation to memorize anything--that's the stupidity undermining any intellectual property. If anything sparks you up, run it, change it, you know this. It's wicked, though, and I have barely read much of it. Nietzsche is a heavy read, man, so it's to your benefit to read slow and chill on it--it's like metaphyscial hard liquor, be careful. Ultimately, don't get strongly convinced by anything from anyone, even yourself--that's known as self-hangman. Instead, pivot--rotate things that you take seriously so you don't get stuck on one thing; otherwise, that's known as abusing a virtue into a vice. And a lot of people don't like that idea of rotation, or avoiding convergence--in fact, all of STEM is driven by convergence. Hence how academia messes up everything when MBA's convince engineers into certainties like the Nazi's did with basterdized Nietzschean ideas. Again, out of importance, a Nietzschean mindset is on the move--no camping like those dimwits in video games. Seriously, look at what academia did to history by forcing it into the secularist myth of certainty; by doing that, much of the neccessary patterns get lost because academia can't appreciate sincerity, enough, to rotate the seemingly contradictory. That's why poets have historically, been responsible for carrying on the patterns of the past--before academia-numbskulls became convincing. 

[2] Passage 25 from "Beyond Good and Evil" by Nietzsche. This is why I don't like the idea of being on stage; it's not that I have stage freight, because I've ripped it up on enough live-audience (physically) performances; it's that I don't want to become stage freight and get into some dumb shenanigan where I look like this gladiator clown fighting for some certainty that doesn't exist. Yet, with that in mind, I'm rock-solid about being dogmatic over (1) and (2). And maybe I am a (disciplined) clown--that's why I like walking outside, finding oppurtunties to pop off when no one is looking; all that's left are these weirdos :) watching me write this to you--probably.

[3] Finally, passage 6 from the chapter "Nostalgia - Daydreams under Changing Skies" from the book "Pleasures And Days" by Proust {p-roost}. This is, by far, the most touching and digestable read. In fact, that chapter starts with a bit from Emerson that I have to strive for just to keep my energy: *So the poet's habit of living should be set on a key so low that the common influences should delight [one]. [Ones] cheerfulness should be the gift of the sunlight; the air should suffice for [ones] inspiration, and [one] should be tipsy with water.* That entry 6 is surreal. It makes me hold a crooked eye to Disney for robbing people--knowingly or unknowingly on either end of this--of their conscious immortality: the perspective that keeps you alive by simply having it, without making it come true. For once you put your dream into reality, it is no longer yours--you just gave it away. And that brings us back to self-hangman, where you can have a dream, but have something else to rotate back to so you don't get stuck on what doesn't fully belong to you in reality--which then creates this dissociation in your mentality becuase you take it to be yours. And that's a taste of how absurd our culture wars are, right now. That disconnection is awful, and doesn't have to be there. And, perhaps, now, you sense my instinct to trash my work.

# Conclusion:

At any rate, spitting with Dave is the next move for me. Check out Markov Chains on Wikipedia; I like those because your next move is based on the last thing that happened--that way, you don't fall victim to the foolishness of planning ahead. In fact, the only reason I found your album was because of some reference--which I can't recall--from another song when I was mixing up a Spotify Queue, that made me think of you. Then I saw you had a new album, which surprised me, so I liked the whoe thing and queued it up; because I knew you put some distance between you and Hip-Hop. It's wild when one gets, too, considerate of others; it's like an Icarus flying too high. My point about Markov Chains, right now, is that this note only exists because I heard your new album on July 24th around noontime EST--good looks!

My favorite side of a vinyl is side C of "Weird Scenes Inside the Gold Mine" by The Doors!
