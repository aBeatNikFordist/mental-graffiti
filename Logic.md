Sup Logic,

# "Honey" For Any Bees Trying To Trap Logic--The Artist:

Look, objectivity is quite a touchy subject, conceptually. For it wants to waltz right into prejudice, every time. But, as life-forms, I (1) have to strongly assert that life-preservation is an objective good and, definitively, a logical truth--given logic requires life to be preserved in order for it to come into existence and, ideally, persist indefinitely; that is, ideal for logic. Interestingly enough, that assertion applies to you and the theory, simultaneously. And then, (2) wherever there is a culture, nation, or society with a gross history of slavery, showing sincere graditude to that hard work is, plainly, in order. I cannot see how most people--regardless of sensitivity--would disagree with showing and giving appreciation to sheer hard work. Furthermore, such a transformation of the enslaved to the humbly empowered is an impeccable maneuver. For those making the room, it becomes this act of revelation, and for those, finally, breathing in respectable room, it is graceful and inspirational--a "Lucky You" by Eminem and Joyner, as it were.

Such a societal metamorphosis, if you will, is bonding, in terms of pairwise respect; without enforcing integration, in some sickening manner.

Ultimately, to rip-off Proust: I'm in Search of Lost Breathing Room. I'd like to think that this 'breathing room' would kick-off an inferno of innovation. Yet, humility is necessary--it must be believed to be "cool"--for once one exhibits it, I, personally, find it to be very chill; whilst having a fire to pop-off as a means for self-defense, which connects this breathing room to life preservation; giving us (1) and (2) to be independently and collectively good and truthful--objectively. But this "truth" is a dependency, a foundation necessary for any other work--not some discovery. Where humility is the firehose against envy, expectations, and resentment.

And to counter those aforesaid thoughts with any argument, makes me assume, confidently, that you don't respect life as a life-form, nor hard work, and, thus, you don't respect meaningfulness. Such a state of existence is an absorbing one--slothfulness paves the pathway to DOOM, as it is put. Thus, there is the immense challenge of overcoming the static energy to kick-off work--work as in effectiveness, and effectiveness as in output not undermined by resources. And the kinetic energy to keep work flowing is, rather, self-reinforcing--momentum. And this "energy" is, simply, spirituality, itself. Look, to antinatilistically or nihilistically disagree, here, makes you asshat backwards, as a life-form--to me.

Consider a book I threw out--which I bought to strength test myself: "The Conspiracy Against The Human Race" by a horror-fiction writer turned realist for such a book. The day I tied hard work to meaningfulness is the day I beat that book without reading any word inside of it. How could this man bust his ass in proclamation of meaninglessness? - That endeavor, clearly, satisfied him, even subtly. Thus, he was deluded by determinism and took a joy-ride--which he claims is about meaninglessness and you are optimistically delusional to disagree with him; shut your face, you wrote a DAMN., persuasive, book--or so I'm led to believe that it is convincing.

But, who knows, perhaps insecurity and intolerance will just ruin all these ideas--not as dogmatic beggary, on my part, to convince you, but honestly: I think those two qualities might mess up anything--for worse.

# Alright, Let Me Tell You About Dave: 

1. I'm looking to do training days with Dave to nail down freestyling.
2. In fact, I didn't even know about Thoreau until we discussed Emerson.
3. He's a lion, though; he wants to run it in a pack.
4. Now, a spirit only grows in solitude.
5. But, a body only houses a spirit by staying social.
6. He's got a sharp-eye for opportunities and wants to hunt them down, sooner than later.
7. He gathers attention like a charisma-master.
8. He's worth reflection and credit.
9. But longevity with him would spell a crippling end to me.
10. Watch tiger documentaries; granted I'm not dogmatic to that nature, but still--

# STILL:

My bad for popping off; I knew you liked video games. So, I played off that with Crash Bandicoot; because it's a tough-ass, rigorous game. And, I, really, only didn't like you taking a shot at "I'll body anybody ... a Gambino."

And I only hucked the “everybody dies” little bobby hoodie as a response to the COVID lockdown; because of the stress from optimizing the global distribution of vaccines for the richest man, pre-COVID19--granted I don't remember all the words I said, and I delete my work so it only comes back if it, really, should. I was in the midst of crashing hard over a handful of years, when I did that weaponizing piece. At the time, I was quite frustrated with the fraudulence of academic research and so that--in combination with a genuine intrigue for philosophy--gave me the spite to go the philosophy route. Then, I went the psychology route when many--especially family--became intolerant of my speech and, perhaps, even envious of an education that was slowly becoming more about "binding" than "finding," so to speak.  

Tell Eminem there's not a big enough "My Bad" that I can give him for that near 20-minute, random forest, fire-storm.  

# Mac:

Good looks on your 2010 reference: listening to Mac. I was doing that, too, but with my buddy Troy: freestyling, “blowin’ swishers” :), and cruising. In fact, I didn't even know Mac until Troy showed me him. I would always grab beats off datpiff.com back then; that's how I found you, Hopsin, Cole, and KRIT.  

“License and registration, please.”  
(i hand that over)  
“Have you been drinking?”  
(i was bobbing and weaving around pot-holes)  
‘No, officer.’  
“Mind if I take a look in the back?”  
(there’s only free weights to hold down my first car: literally, the white Dude, Where’s My Car? car--for correcting fishtails on snowy, new england roads that you do not Drive Slow on, homie)  
‘Sure.’  
(finds nothing)  
“Step out of the car.”  
(troy is all-too-justifiably nervous whilst holding down his composure like a champ)  
“Walk this line”  
(did it)  
… (other shit)  
“Alright, have you been smoking?”  
‘I was, but it’s all gone, now.’  
“Alright, and where are you heading to?”  
‘Haverhill’  
“From?”  
‘Haverhill’  
“So, you’re heading to Haverhill, from Haverhill, through Salibury?”  
(that’s a merrimack valley BC on 110)  
‘Yes.’  
“Alright, now, I want you to follow the tip of my pen.”  
(he moves it laterally)  
(i cannot snoop-dog focus on it)  
(but then a moth flew by my face)  
‘Uhh, my bad, that moth is distracting me.’  
“Alright, we’ll restart.”  
(this time I blindly scan my eyes with what i believe to be the moving position of the pen)  
“Alright, you’re all set--drive safely back to Haverhill.”  
(i get in the car)  
(troy has nothing to say)  
(cop drives away)  
(i spark up the second blunt left in the compartment under the tape-deck that aux-plugs into my mp3 of datpiff.com beats)  
(troy shakes his head in pseudo-shame that he has to deal with this white boy)  
(we go back to freestyling like knuckle-heads)  

# Album:

Solid move with this album, I've been buying vinyls lately, myself. There's a lot of relatable and humorous references, in all seriousness--as of Breath Control, then I had to start writing all this, and then my phone died in the middle of my long-ass Amherst street walk. Don't worry, I won't be a grand fool; I'll listen to it, at least, a handful of times--like "Menace" from Banks, "Heaven and Hell" from Ye, "Kumbaya" and "Picasso" by Hopsin, and definitely "Cold Summer" by Fabolous ... and the two "Watchers" (shhh--seriously, though, i’m trusting ya’ll with all this).  

# Dumb People:

Some people probably think you're not that good because they don't appreciate the narrative element of writing--and speaking. Which seems to be how you differentiate yourself from others. Plus, tell these witty folks, calling you "half-cooked," that no one messes with peppers in preparation--furthermore, let's say they are right, well, they don't write any better! BOOM.  

# My Current Mindset:

[1] "The Serious Workman" passage from "Human, All-Too-Human" by Nietzsche {knee-cher}. This is my rough approach, maybe 5 years "in the underground" is more realistic--but I don't want to set off something I don't know, with confidence, will sustain--even though I have the energy for it; that's why I keep trashing my work; I assume it will expire into something rancid: STILL.--even though I strongly stand by everything I'm saying, right now. Including the ridiculous amount of material I permanently deleted from google keep, instagram, and twitter.

Honestly, let Hip-Hop know about this one section from that book: "From The Soul Of Artists And Writers." It's worth reading random bits and pieces from; but don't hold yourself to some dumb expectation to memorize any of it--that's the stupidity undermining any intellectual property. If anything sparks you up, run it, change it, you know this. It's wicked, though, and I have barely read much of it. Nietzsche is a heavy read, man, so it's to your benefit to read slow and chill on it--it's like metaphysical, hard liquor, be careful. Ultimately, don't get strongly convinced by anything from anyone, even yourself--that's known as self-hangman. Instead, pivot--rotate things that you take seriously so you don't get stuck on one thing; otherwise, that's known as abusing a virtue into a vice. And a lot of people don't like that idea of rotation, or avoiding convergence--in fact, all of STEM is driven by convergence. Hence how academia messes up everything when MBA's convince engineers into certainties like the Nazi's did with basterdized Nietzschean ideas. Again, out of importance, a Nietzschean mindset is on the move--no camping like those dimwits in video games. Seriously, look at what academia did to history by forcing it into the secularist myth of certainty; by doing that, much of the necessary patterns get lost--like bad PCA--because academia can't appreciate sincerity, enough, to rotate the seemingly contradictory. That's why poets have historically been responsible for carrying on the patterns of the past--before academia-numbskulls became convincing.  For they offer the various-point perspectives which we all desperately need--even from bad poets, like me.  

[2] Passage 25 from "Beyond Good and Evil" by Nietzsche. This is why I don't like the idea of being on stage; it's not that I have stage freight, because I've ripped it up on enough live-audience (physical) performances; it's that I don't want to become stage freight and get into some dumb shenanigan where I look like this gladiator-clown fighting for some certainty that doesn't exist--with or without politeness of speech, man, politeness is the worst virtue because that's how the prejudiced hide. Yet, with that in mind, I'm rock-solid about being dogmatic over (1) and (2) from the first section. And maybe I am a (disciplined) clown--that's why I like walking outside, finding opportunities to pop-off when no one is looking; all that's left are these weirdos :) watching/listening to me write this to you--probably.  

[3] Finally, passage 6 from the chapter "Nostalgia - Daydreams under Changing Skies" from the book "Pleasures And Days" by Proust {p-roost}. This is, by far, the most touching and digestible read of these three. In fact, that chapter starts with a bit from Emerson that I have to strive for just to keep my energy: *So the poet's habit of living should be set on a key so low that the common influences should delight [one]. [Ones] cheerfulness should be the gift of the sunlight; the air should suffice for [ones] inspiration, and [one] should be tipsy with water.* That entry 6 is surreal, though. It makes me hold a crooked eye to Disney for robbing people--knowingly or unknowingly on either end of this--of their conscious immortality: the perspective that keeps you alive by simply having it, without making it come true. For once you put your dream into reality, it is no longer yours--you just gave it away. And that brings us back to self-hangman, where you can have a dream, but have something else to rotate back to so you don't get stuck on what doesn't fully belong to you, in reality; otherwise, such a conviction creates this dissociation in your mentality--abstractly, not chemically, don't listen to these Psychologist's Fallacies by "professionals" who don't even speak about William James--all because you take it to be, absolutely, yours. And that's a taste of how absurd our culture wars are, right now. That disconnection is awful, and it doesn't have to be there--go outside and watch birds fly until you respect the inexplicable and uncontrollable. And, perhaps, now, you sense my instinct to trash my work:  

i'm just letting my spirit breathe  
man  
“Whatcha’ Sayin’ [Nick]?”  
(you know that mixtape)  
if you’re looking for a T.I.P.--  
i am talking lil’ wayne

loaded up

unportrayable Canon--  
i don't do it for the canon!  
like my mother and father

to spell out my DNA.  

# Conclusion:

At any rate, spitting with Dave is the next move for me. Check out Markov Chains on Wikipedia; I like those because your next move is based on the last thing that happened--that way, you don't fall victim to the foolishness of planning ahead. In fact, the only reason I found your album was because of some reference--which I can't recall--from another song when I was mixing up a Spotify Queue, that made me think of you. Then I saw you had a new album, which surprised me, so I liked the whole thing, on instinct, and queued it up; because I knew you put some distance between you and Hip-Hop. It's wild when one gets, too, considerate of others; it's like an Icarus flying too high. My point about Markov Chains, right now, is that this whole piece only exists because I heard your new album, today, for first time, on July 24th around noontime EST--good looks!  

My favorite side of a vinyl is side C of "Weird Scenes Inside the Gold Mine" by The Doors!  

Best,  
Nick  

# Post Script:

It's July 25th in the AM--noontime as I clean this up, kind of--and I listened to your album this morning, front to back--after being inspired by "Cold Summer" after a couple years of swimming circles in a Nietzschean Abyss; no (mac) exaggeration. I'm talking head in the clouds, feet on the ground; I only pop-off demon, siren-song poetry when I get, too, deep in my head. Logic, you literally followed suit on Nietzsche's Ten-Year plan for artists before they blow up--that was what I was referring to in [1]. Nietzsche is known for DESTROYING false dichotomies and it scares the living shit out of every thinker--that's you! And you put Blu & Exile on, you phenom! Don't be crazy, though, Saul Williams, Jean Grae, and Aseop Rock are mythological forces of other-wordly natures that make Jay Electronica look like he fits in--artistically. Watch out for "Neptune Frost," man. I betcha' you'll try to spit with 'em all anyway. You know what would be nasty? - You, Kid Cudi, Blueprint, and Illogic on a track. But don't let Eminem know I suggested that adventure. In fact, I triple, DMX, Manchester, NH, dogs from hell, Bukowski-style, dare you to get Eminem to mix it up with Aseop Rock--I bet computers will (metaphysically) blow up. And then save Immortal Technique to atomically clear the playing field. I don't know what your cowboying, college park, plans are--so I'm just brainstorming, here.  

"I got more tracks on this than heroin addicts." - DAMN. dude. I got one for you: Data Scientists rely on numpy more than dopeheads rely on spoons to be fed. That line comes from a comment I wrote in a python script called burroughs.py where I bash artificial intelligence with a text-generation A.I.--a long short-term memory, bidirectional, neural network, that learns from BACK PROPAGATION--literally a robot William Burroughs randomly sampling literature to spit some shit. This "scientific" mechanism is literally known as the Cut-Up Method and no one in STEM will give that man credit for doing what most machine learning algorithms do--random sampling to find novel patterns. Obviously, I threw that accursed python script out.  

Here's another spin-off I did from your "sold out the garden" line:  
what do you do  
when you wrote out the garden?  
what do you do  
when your head is still nodding?--  
listening to music  
all-too-often  

YO! Action Bronson has the best verse on the album--no offense--when he paints a picture of some inconceivable Jet Li crap--I know I'll die laughing everytime, and I only heard the verse, twice, at this point.  

And you put Game on, he's a beast.

tell lupe fiasco i have the same blue yeti mic he uses on his podcast with royce. tell lupe i wrote the illest heartbreak poem while listening to "Mural" just upstairs from my ex who i still l(i)ved with--who i learned ASL for, which taught me language is only learned out of love. that's why children learn it so quickly, and teenagers revolt against american white lies from parents who would rather raise society instead of kids. and i know it was dope because it made Michelle, a mental graffiti poet, who, by comparison, would make any male look like a real man, if they were half as strong as her: "it's not until you have been smashed into a thousand pieces, and you have put yourself back together, that you can call yourself a STRONG. woman." anyhow, i lost that piece; here's the best i can recall from it:  
...  
i walk up the stairs  
i peek through the blinds  
to see shoes that are not mine  
for the first time  
i turn the cold autumn, cloudless, night sky, counter clockwise  
and he gets right up to shake my hand with a gleeful smile  
"hi! my name is..."  
...  
my last two girlfriends' favorite color is purple, my gram's is yellow, and i don't know about my mom's.  

Did you see me tearing it up on twitter the past number of days? - I had a seperate account called @EngineersPoet and I blitzed it specifically for Steven A. Smith, by following Curry, A.I., and Marcus Smart--recall the end of Snoop's "Focused" -> "ten-toes ... i put it on Marcus."--shotgun-spraying prejudice and anti-fordism (that's the version of capitalism that everyone hates because it's designed to benefit the insecure who want vanity, not power).  

Since June, when I didn't even know you dropped this album, I have been on some straight-up American Exile shit (write out "I'll" and then put a horizontal line through it: american x-i'll). I was writing a hip-hop epic called Dead 'N Absent--dedicated to any Jackson--spelling out my DNA. I was head-hunting for American law that has contradicted itself into legislated anarchy which makes all laws unenforceable by deductive explosion. This happened to mathematics with the very foundation of all math--Set Theory--it had a contradiction in it which LOGICALLY means anything is allowed. So, our American "Law & Order" is literally: slave-hunting.  

Then I started up a slide-deck to do some Roman's Revenge type-shit called "her favorite color" - you hear that Blu & Exile album? - Anyhow, that approach was all about: her favorite color (purple) being the amulet of all love--lost: Katrina Lives, Still, Matter; for 'Black Lives Matter' has always been a matter of fact, NOT rank--that's how you undress prejudice, right quick. And such a slogan is, literally, a logical truth as I went over in the first section of this piece.  

Ask the FBI about my deleted shit, you can have at it, man--something always has to come from something else, there is no first origin; because "nothing" doesn't have a quality, which means it doesn't have the possibility of providing anything--all is transitory, every "beginning" is, merely, a threshold waiting to be passed over: "This world is my contraption, [PLAGIARISM!] :)" - Everyone is a biter of thoughts that came from a place which didn't want them anymore! - COLD facts. If you can get access to the two pieces I did for Kendrick on "her favorite color," check 'em out, first--I'm serious, ask the FBI or some shit, they are watching me type this out, right now, anyway. Just stay away from Sam Harris, he's my target--watch "The Psychology Of A Tiger" by Thoughty2 on YouTube. But I'm going to need help with Mark Cuban's not so maverack, anti-fordist, "tail between his shark-legs," bitch-ass--that slimy smile as he rapes engineers into driving a streetcar named desire on a course called efficiency until our society deadlines over dumb deadlines. What's the rush? - None, you talked about gratitude for life in this album--you know this.  

Here, check out some of the deleted shit I can still remember and mix up--prototype material for College Park(our), I'll call it:  
R.E.M.E.M.B.E.R. is my name

And read my current, first 24 tweets that I spun-dialed up on July 24th without counting them out--and then read the 25th which spells out a condensed timeline of my childhood: #epitaphOfABryant  

And I started freestyling on J Dilla's Delights Vol. 1--on my way to the coffee shop where I wrote this last section--because of how you kicked-off this album--it was pretty dope; the FBI guys (and ladies) know this. I also queued up "I Do It For Hip-Hop" because you referenced Ludacris. Yo, do me a favor and make sure Hopsin stays safe. Don't tell him I said that, though. He's someone you look out for because he does the same--"who am i? i'm [picah_zero]." Check out "Kill Your Darlings" - Lucien Carr and William Burroughs in that movie are unforgettable. Look, consider jumping up on a table in a music video if you've got some slam poetry material--fuck a rhyme, unless you can't help it--for a verse in a song; those type of poets will SNAP. I'm telling you, if you want to railroad BOOMBAP. back into the game; mix in some grand slam poetry--I'm talking Garciaparra, nomar-lizing out this accursed mumbling that puts SCAT. to shame.  

beat,  
Nick  

P.S.  

I, seriously, and personally, don't mean to belittle your best recieved album--as of yet--but that homicide number which Cole refers to in "The Climb Back" is a number we need these days--as in the kind of number that is not as convincing as the one you cemented into the culture. I, genuinely, get fired up everytime the end of that song plays--I can't listen to it much because people will think I'm nuts for popping off about it. But who wouldn't? - The kind of people who think politeness is so important, such that they're blind to serious concerns--hence their soft-spoken tones. If you don't have an attitude these days, you're, beyond all reasonable doubt, the far-out one--you're the lost one. Feel free to tell anybody who has a problem with attitude, what I tell them: "I give you my attitude so you know that you're not beneath my contempt--that means I don't see you lower than the level of a slave."  And, feel free to tell anyone calling you “pretentious” that you’re not as much as they are, when their insecurity wants to outrank you with that “criticism.”  

Yo, I even dare you to get the FBI to let you hear the conversation I had in the Toadstool bookstore yesterday, July 24th--it was wicked. I'm telling you to tell them you have my permission on all this--it's my personal information, to begin with. I'll show Big Brother who Big Brother is, on Twitter, if they don't let you have at it this stuff. And I already have another rough piece, which I’ll clean up, later, in this repository--dedicated to the original slam poetry squad that got me headstrong about writing: Mental Graffitti--for Elon Musk if Twitter tries locking me out of my account again; let's go, man.  

Share all this with whomever, if you want--even Hopsin :)  
Be Good.  

WAIT. did you know the hardest song I ever made was called "Arthur" from a beat by UNION44? - Straight up, a hurricane was named Arthur the next day, or the day of--without me knowing it. And its music video by Winnekenni Castle, after I hauled ASS all day around helltown hills to put together my last completed mixtape "States Of Union" which Ye followed me on, immediately, until I imploded on instagram. And then the first and last lines in my first mixtape: "A Dog Named Jake" - "A Dog Named Jake is my first mixtape ... Generation Y, gotta' clean up after X, so Z ain't the last ..." And the last mixtape I never finished was "Mystery Brew" with Helltown's HOMEBREW RECORDS, at the time, who gave me a Caesar haircut at T-Stop. I'm growing my hair out to get that again, only on rare occasions like this one, ya know--  

And I keep spinning off kdot's DAMN. because the last thing I want to do is take any attention that he deserves far more than me--when I would, nirvana covering david bowie, bet the world he could outrun my mouth if he wasn't restricted by this insecure, ungrateful, incapable of giving thanks because they'd rather run away from genealogical guilt, anti-fordist marketplace. Everytime I think of kendrick, I think of Bad-Meets-Evil's "Take From Me;" I will not--  

You know the mood: irritable-chill, like the loveliest Rottweilers.

And then I forgot something rather important that I vibe with from Thoreau in his essay:   Life Without Principle--  
As I paraphrase--  
"There is a type which cannot be bought, no matter what resources you offer one. The effective do what they can for the community--whether they get paid for it or not. Whereas the ineffective offer their ineffectiveness to the highest bidder--expecting to get a hold of some higher rank. And often, enough, they are not disappointed."
