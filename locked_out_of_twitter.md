# Violated Freedom Of Speech:
## last tweets meant for Elon Musk as a note during a 'zeros and ones' Jordan Peterson podcast
*I'm assuming these internet satyrs want to force feed me this episode in one single go without digesting it maticulously, in real-time, to illustrate how legimate engineers take notes, by taking notes as an idea from the speakers sparks my interest. Perhaps, my STEM overseers, puppeteered by their managers with the delusion of resources--for they don't respect freedom, as it is now--are frustrated with not being careful themselves; as envy mixed with expectations, incentivizes your insecurity to bloom resentment, releasing the necessary fumes for your intolerance; for prejudice must smell magnificent to you like flies on crap.*

*Genuinely, Jordan, I was looking forward to the rest of your episode, but when I am abhorrently cut off from "the internet" on Twitter but not on every other app of mine, we see that breathing room is not a goal of whatever "design" these interweb overseers have in mind. And, say, this was all a test, what then? - Then you lost all the trust you were being given when you weren't worth it--you still persist a slave-hunter's mindset, you ignoble parasites. For you cannot provide service when you claim to have it--nor do you respect that only thoughts had while walking have value; hence why I would be nice enough to interrupt a most beautiful day at the beach to share my sincere thoughts that you would rather give a stiff(y)-arm to like the perverted children--or incapable adults--that you must, still, be.*

Nonetheless, Musk,

I was caught, early on, by Jordan's in-law talking about how engineers--in my words--are Markov chain, gang-banged by MBA's--not industrial engineers, perhaps, not even MBA's--into probabilistically transitioning products and services--that they work on in isolated fashion--into an absorbing--cash cow--state at, or near, the bottom of a path on a some unsupervised Branch-and-Bound-ing decision tree. 

Thus, there is no regard for searching breadth--all incessant convergence, no explorative divergence; despite our exponential advancements of smashing more into less and less space to reflect how we respect space less and less. That is our industry's "innovation" and we stay committed to the bad old roots that kicked off our route to this "grand" absorbing--cash cow--state--more like the death of God state, in all seriousness.

Now, tell me, is that, really, business? Industrialization? Innovation? - No, it is addiction--it is like me smoking and drinking too much at a Jim Jefferies show despite being front-row--much like you, right now, if you, still, think you respect the laws of economics and creation. 

"Haha!" We got this "punk" to admit he is a grand fool, himself--well, all the better then; but why must you be so childish and insecure yourselves by stiff-arming my freedom with yours?

Do you, really, respect freedom, then? Do you, really, trust what other people may do with their freedom? - Because if you don't, then you don't, actually, have a problem with other people, but with freedom, itself. You, yourself, doubt it like every idiot, proud to consider themselves secular whilst undermining faith in themselves, hence the s-tri-angulation of others--delusional determinism once more. 

These Son's of Sam's Harrisment, so to speak, blantly, blocked me from Twitter--without any legimate notification of restriction; for there is none to show for in this case--which I was using, strictly, to show appreciation to those I find beautiful or excellent. Otherwise, I wouldn't have tweeted about you, in the first place, you clowns.

But beyond the respect for others by granting them my creative interpretations of them within my own perspective of other matters, in utterly honest fashion, I have a single goal of creating breathing room--which must bother these hang[people].

Best,

Nick Morris

P.S. 

Jordan, good looks for putting an engineer on the podcast. That's the kind of awareness we need confidence to be built around. So, no one has to be a stupid hero(en).
